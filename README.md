# Minecraft Drop Randomizer

This plugin makes Minecraft unpredictable by dropping **a random item** when a block is broken or a mob dies.

- Server-side Spigot plugin; no client-side installation required!
- Tested with Minecraft 1.21.7, but should work on other versions
- Ideal to give a spin to speedrun challenges! I would love to see/hear your ideas!

You can see me playing with the mod in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuEGubmong4)!

## How It Works

- Breaking any block or killing a mob drops a single random item
- This is also the case if blocks breaking or mob deaths are not caused by the player
- Fortune and Looting enchantments have no effect
- Items can be anything, even those not usually obtainable in survival (e.g., spawn eggs, command blocks)


## Commands
Any operator can enable or disable either feature at any time without uninstalling the plugin.

- Enable or disable random drops from breaking blocks with `/randomizeBlockDrops true|false`  
  
- Enable or disable random drops from dying mobs with `/randomizeMobDrops true|false`  
  

## Setting Up The Mod
You just need to download the `.jar` file and put it into the `plugins` folder of your **spigot** server.

You don't need to download any of the other files. They are just there to help anyone interested to understand how the plugin works.
